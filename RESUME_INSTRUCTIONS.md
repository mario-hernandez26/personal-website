# Resume PDF Instructions

## Adding Your Resume

To add your resume to the website:

1. **Place your resume PDF** in this directory (`Code/persona-website/`)
2. **Name it exactly**: `resume.pdf`
3. The download button in the resume section will automatically work once the file is added

## Current Status

⚠️ **Note**: The resume PDF file (`resume.pdf`) is not included in this repository. You need to add it manually.

The website is already set up to link to `resume.pdf` - just add the file and it will work!

## Alternative Options

If you want to use a different filename:

1. Rename your PDF file to `resume.pdf`, OR
2. Update the link in `index.html`:
   - Find: `<a href="resume.pdf" class="btn btn-primary" download>`
   - Change `resume.pdf` to your actual filename
